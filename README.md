# to_do_list
This Python-based To-Do List application provides an intuitive way to manage tasks. Users can create, view, delete, replace, and mark tasks as complete or incomplete. Additionally, tasks can be filtered or searched for easier navigation, and all data can be saved to or loaded from a file using Python's pickle module.
